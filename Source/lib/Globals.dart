    '''Hello! I am Ali Haydar. I graduated from Karab√ºk University in computer engineering and I am passionate about software development. I have been working with the Flutter framework for more than 2 years and I am constantly improving myself in this field. Additionally, I have 1 year of work experience with Unity Engine and took part in mobile game development processes.

The complex application I developed with Flutter and the mobile games I published with Unity gave me the opportunity to showcase my talents and creativity in the software world. These experiences encouraged me to further my technical skills and develop further in new projects.

I am currently improving myself further in Flutter and looking for new job opportunities in this field. I look forward to contributing and developing unique applications as part of an innovative team.

I am someone who likes to take responsibility, is prone to teamwork and is willing to constantly learn. I look forward to collaborating on new projects and achieving great success together. Feel free to contact me!''';
